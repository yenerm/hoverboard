What do these actually mean? Why do they work for their proponents? Will they work for you?With the seemingly simple, yet fun and complex game of hangman, we’ll connect the dots between all of these ideas by teasing out simple principles around information gain, failure, success and diversity from the game.We’ll then explore how we, as software engineers, can apply those principles to write better code, work in teams more effectively and deliver software that provides long term value.With the seemingly simple, yet fun and complex game of hangman, we’ll connect the dots between all of these religions by teasing out simple principles around information gain, failure, success and diversity from the game.We’ll then explore how we, as software engineers, can apply those principles to write better code, work in teams more effectively and deliver software that provides long term value.",

        "description": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are the new big thing in web development, but it’s a mistake to simply endorse or reject them. More than a set of technologies, PWAs are about reframing how we build apps for the web and mobile. They’re about building speed and security and responsiveness right into the app instead of relying on fast devices and connections. They’re about making web apps do everything native apps can do without rewriting your entire codebase for different platforms.In this talk you’ll learn how to build progressive web apps and decide why you might or might not want to.",

This talk will focus on seven great open source libraries which do fix Android's programming model, the way jquery fixes javascript. The libraries will be covered with example code, advantages, disadvantages, internals and when to use them.",
